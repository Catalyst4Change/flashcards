## Whatâ€™s going on here?
This project was designed and built by Catalyst for my Turing School of Software & Design Module 2 premier solo project. The goal was to create a working flashcard game is playable on Terminal's Command Line Interface. The game should keep track of cards guessed correctly and display a percentage of correct guesses at the end of the game.\

## How did you make this?:
This project is made entirely with vanilla JavaScript and includes 25 tests that guided my development. I believe I worked on it for 10 hours total.

Frankly I struggled with this project. I was not able to complete it before the deadline. I think with just a few more hours, I could complete it but <i>c'est la vie</i>.

As with most projects, the hardest part was getting started. It was difficult to conceptualize how a game like this would work without a typical graphical interface. Once I got started, I was able to work in fits and starts.\
Writing the tests to check if the deck was being written correctly was a pain. At first I was proud of my jokey test card, but when the tests called for a succession of different cards to make sure score was being kept correctly, I found that I'd written myself into a corner.\
Also, the test, "When a guess is made, a new Turn instance is created." was incompatible with the way that I wrote my code, so I ignored it.\
Another problem that stopped me in my tracks was calculating the win/loss percentage at the end. I am not good at math under the best circumstances, and having an extra layer of complication that is code made it basically impossible. I had to have someone hold my hand and walk me through the process.

Speaking of holding my hand, I would like to thank my mentor Alia, and my friends at Turing. Without them siting along side while I coded, I would not have gotten as much done as I did.

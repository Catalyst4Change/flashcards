// Your Game class should meet these other requirements:
// Should keep track of the currentRound
// start: method that starts everything
// Creates Cards
// Puts Cards in a Deck
// Creates a new Round using the Deck
// invokes printMessage to display the message in the CLI
// invokes printQuestion to kick off our helper functions that allow interaction via the CLI
// Note: The helper functions are all fleshed out and fit to work with classes/methods that meet the requirements in the past iterations.

// Your game.start() method should be invoked to make the game playable in the console.
// Look at the file being run when we want to start the game. Think about where you need to invoke your Game.start method.
